= ChangeLog

== 2010-04-07 Support for Bootstrap Actions

* Added support for bootstrap actions including a new command line parameter
  --bootstrap-action

* Added some extra command line options such as --plain-output, --ssh, 
  and --scp. The --ssh command now waits for the jobflow to be running
  before contacting unless the --no-wait flag is passed.

== 2010-05-27 Support for Hadoop 0.20 and Hive 0.5

* Added support for specifying Hadoop version using --hadoop-version option.  
  Hadoop 0.20 supports Hive 0.5 and Hadoop 0.18 supports Hive 0.4. The default
  Hadoop version is 0.20. 

* Added support for installing Hive using hive-script instead of directly 
  installing a particular version of Hive.
  
* Added support for streaming arguments of Hadoop 0.20 (-files, -archives, -D).

== 2010-09-16 Support for fetching files from EMR

* Added --get option to scp from files EMR. Added symmetric --put option that 
  behaves exactly like --scp.

* Added new arguments for resizing running job flows --add-instance-group, 
  --modify-instance-group, and --unarrest-instance-group.

* Substantially reworked processing arguments to be more consistent and unit testable.

* Fixed processing of Pig and Hive script commands to allow
  --hive-script CMD and --hive-script --args CMD as well 

* Fixed processing of --main-class

== 2011-01-24 Bug fixes

  days rather than the last day

== 2011-08-05 Added Support for running JobFlow in the Spot Market

* You may now specify a bit price when creating instance groups,

* Fixed the Elastic IP code and associated --eip command line option which
  were broken by the last release.
